## 4. FAQ

*Q1:* Why the jar file is much larger (about 100 mb) compared to others?

*A:* Due to the mass use of external libraries, the `Duck.jar` contains not only the executable program, but also all of the 
    libraries as well as output file (.json). So that, users do not need to copy the data file (.json) when he wants to use Kuri on another
    computer. Only one `Duck.jar` is needed.
